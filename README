This is the client program of Infiniverse, a "massively"
multiplayer online space game that features a huge
procedurally generated universe presented in ASCII graphics.

This is a DEVELOPMENT RELEASE, meaning it is incomplete and
contains lots of bugs. For Credits, see AUTHORS and THANKS files.
License information can be found in the COPYING file.

The game should automatically update itself, whenever a new
version is available.
