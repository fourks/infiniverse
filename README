This is a single-player "alpha sneak-peak" version of
Infiniverse, a massively multiplayer online space game
that features a huge procedurally generated universe
presented in ASCII graphics.

This is a DEVELOPMENT RELEASE, meaning it is incomplete and
contains lots of bugs. For Credits, see AUTHORS and THANKS files.
License information can be found in the COPYING file.

The game should automatically update itself, whenever a new
version is available, but don't hope too much.

HELP
	Run the game by executing either infiniverse-client (linux)
	or infiniverse-client.exe (windows). The updater is run
	automatically.

	Use F1 key inside the game to get (context sensitive)
	listing of available controls.
